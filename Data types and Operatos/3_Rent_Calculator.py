# Five Star Retro Video rents VHS tapes and DVDs to the same connoisseurs who like to 
# buy LP record albums. The store rents new videos for $3.00 a night, and oldies for $2.00 
# a night. Write a program that the clerks at Five Star Retro Video can use to calculate the 
# total charge for a customerâ€™s video rentals. The program should prompt the user for the 
# number of each type of video and output the total
